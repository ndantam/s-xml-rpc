S-XML-RPC
=========

S-XML-RPC is an implementation of XML-RPC in Common Lisp for both
client and server. Originally it was written by Sven Van Caekenberghe.

QUIRKS
------

* Under SBCL (and probably CMUCL) the s-xml-rpc http server uses the
  built in event loop (SERVE-EVENT).  This does not interact well with
  threaded SLIME.  Workaround is to use SWANK's :FD-HANLDER as follows:

    (setq swank:*communication-style* :fd-handler)
